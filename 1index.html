        <p>
            My name is Aiden Lehman I am 18 years old and I was born
            near Atlanta GA though I was raised in Oxford MS
            and moved to Water Valley MS last November.
            I graduated High School at <a href="https://www.gocommodores.org/o/lhs">Lafayette High School</a>
            in Oxford MS and now go to <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/">Base Camp Coding</a>
            Academy. I was raised in a famliy where I have a mother, father, brother and sister, I am the youngest person in 
            my family and am the only kid who still lives in the house. I currently don't have a job, though I want to have one 
            so that I can buy a second car, though my parents would never approve of this happening. I did work at the bowling
            alley from July 2023 to May 2025 and was able to save up a couple thousand dollars that just sits there.
